# SmartCampusIOT
Repository of codes for the analisis and data processing of the project Geniiot - A smart room with IOT sensors for Energy Efficiency

This project consists on using data from various sensors, like temperature, umidity, luminosity, solar incidence, and such to better understand how can we make the most energy efficient room.

All the code is written in MATLAB, but in future work we pretend to re-write the code in Python.
